                <h2>Every Picture</h2>
                <p>In this Learning Journal, I studied the use of pictures and the interaction of <a
                        href="https://www.loftgarten.co/work">loftgarten</a>.
                </p>
                <p>By Reading "<a
                        href="https://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/">10
                        Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills</a>" I learned that
                    people get a lot of information from pictures. Loftgarten's site is a great combination of user
                    interaction and graphics. It is a portfolio of interior and architectural design. There are nine
                    projects. Users can get thumbnails of numbered works by hovering over unique numbers. These floating
                    pictures are good for getting the reader's interest, at least mine. After clicking the corresponding
                    number, you will enter the feature page of the specified work.
                </p>
                <p>The author uses grand pictures to set off the atmosphere. Some of the sliding pictures show the
                    details of the work well. Even though the author didn't use a lot of words, it was easy for me to
                    get detailed information about the work. I think it's even easier to show your work with pictures
                    than with words. The site was also easy to use, and although the author didn't have any instructions
                    on how to do it, with only a few words and signs I could find what I was looking for.
                </p>
                <p>In a word, I think pictures can quickly and accurately convey information to users and increase the
                    interest in the interaction.

                <h2>Overlays</h2>
                <p>I hate overlays because they often come and surprise me and interrupt my reading experience.
                    Therefore, as a designer, I think it is important to design overlays carefully. Naema
                    Baskanderi's
                    article <a
                        href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">Best
                        Practices for Modals/Overlays/Dialog Windows</a> has provided me with a lot of valuable
                    advice and inspiration. Users don't like overlays because they force users to do things and can
                    suddenly surprise them. But it can also provide users with convenience if the nature of overlays
                    is
                    effectively used.
                </p>
                <p>First, to make users feel comfortable, overlays should be triggered by the user, not
                    automatically ejected. Second, the user should be able to turn off the overlay at any time. This
                    means clearly indicating how to turn them off. Third, overlays are only used for events that
                    need to be highlighted, and too many overlays can annoy the user. In addition, the size of the
                    overlay, its format, and its relevance to the context are all things worth considering.
                </p>
                <p>So I think it's important to be thoughtful and user-centric when designing overlays. My goal was
                    to
                    design overlays that users liked, not overlays that they hated.

                <h2>Forms</h2>
                <p>Forms are used in many places, so it's important to learn some techniques for making forms. By
                    reading Salim Ansari's article <a
                        href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best Practices for
                        Form
                        Design</a>, I summarized some points that should
                    be paid attention to when making forms.</p>
                <p>First, in order to make the user comfortable, it is best for the input items to be a single
                    column,
                    and the amount of input required for each entry should not be too long. If there is a lot of
                    content
                    that needs to be filled in by the user, it can be broken down into different parts, which can
                    reduce
                    the pressure on the user.</p>
                <p>Second, user confusion should be minimized as much as possible. Allowing users to anticipate what
                    they need to fill in can increase productivity. For example, the length of the input box
                    indicates
                    the length of the required input. Avoid unnecessary drop-down menus. Although drop-down menus
                    can
                    provide some interaction, they also waste a lot of time, so buttons are a better choice for
                    fewer
                    options.
                </p>
                <p>Finally, unnecessary troubles should be reduced. For example, use placeholders carefully. While
                    placeholders may seem useful, they have many disadvantages, such as the need for the user to
                    delete
                    input in order to see them. Therefore, important internal usage should be presented through
                    placeholders.</p>
                <p>Human design is very important. The core of FORM design is to make users feel comfortable and
                    improve
                    work efficiency.
